# Todo List
- [ ] Session Features
	- [ ] Key Bindings
		- [ ] Optional Default Handler: Only Handles keys if the keybuffer is empty. If the keybuffer has items in it, then handler isn't called until keybuffer is empty. This would be used for things like insert mode for Vim/Kakoune. It is the job of this handler to put keys in the keybuffer for key sequences.
		- [ ] Keybuffer for all non-handled keys: Keybuffer is used for key sequences. It is matched greedily and once there is a match it will execute a command. It should also flush the keybuffer of the UI since the UI may have its own keybindings. The UI should also be able to flush the keybuffer of the session if it matched something.
	- [ ] Commands
		- [ ] a way to register commands
		- [ ] A way to allow for documentation with commands
		- [ ] a completion interface that can be used to show possible values for a command being entered through the command interface
		- [ ] A way to bind commands to menu elements like a menu bar, sidebar, context menu, etc to the UI from Lua
