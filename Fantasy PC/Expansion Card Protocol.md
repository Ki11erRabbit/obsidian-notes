An expansion card is simply a way for the native operating system or other libraries to interact with the virtual machine to provide additional functionality that the core runtime does not provide.

There needs to be a way for cards to provide an arbitrary way to interact with the "processor." The card provides the api that the programer must follow to interact with it. This provides maximum flexibility as new cards can be created whenever they are needed.
