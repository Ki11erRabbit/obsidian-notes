For blog audience
cs programers who at least know what monads
couldn't tell you what a fixed point is off the top of their head or how monads can do with it

bring up fixed points, datalog, first and follow sets of a context free grammar, ask llm for more examples

bring up parsing and abstract interpretation and go into more detail later
fixpoint is a set of facts (for datalog)
talk about efficiency of our approach

brainstorm ideas that are needed to understand this
talk about mechanics, named comp, and dependencies emerge from computation

keep it accessible and introduce monads and continuations at the end
