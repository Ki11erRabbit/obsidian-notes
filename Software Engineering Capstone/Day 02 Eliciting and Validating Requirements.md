We got Barter Beans in group A


Requirements constantly evolve throughout the project development

# How to elicit

## Who cares? Stakeholders
- end users
- owners
- the programers
- Internal vs. External Stakeholders

Try to identify a list of stakeholders for your project.

## How to learn it? Eliciting Requirements
- ask stakeholders, focus groups, surveys/questionnaires
- observation and shadowing. For example, observe end-users doing their jobs.
- analyze existing system if one exists
- Consider: Minimum Viable Product (**MVP**)

### Do we have it right? Has there been any miscommunication?
- mockups and prototypes (executable or paper)
- frequent, incremental deliveries of working software
- usability testing
- close customer involvement throughout development process

### Non-functional requirements
- Nonfunctional Requirements (NFRs) define system attributes such as security, reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and usability.
- They serve as constraints or restrictions on the design of the system.
- also known as system qualities
- nonfunctional requirements are just as critical as functional requirements

## How to capture what we are learning?
backlog
document requirements through a backlog

things at the top are smaller and easier to implement
size estimates on the backlog
story points are the smallest amount of work a task could take in a group setting
### Items
- features
- defects
- technical work
- knowledge acquisition

Recommend Jira 
but Trello and Github will work

There is a flowchart on the groups page
