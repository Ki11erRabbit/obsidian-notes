# Questions to Consider
- Was the Fall of Adam and Eve good or bad?
- What does the Fall of Adam and Eve teach us about our identity and destiny?
- How do the two commandments in Eden help us understand God's plan
- What is the difference between sin and transgressions?
- What does the Fall teach us about the role of agency in our Heavenly Father's plan of salvation?

The fall had a twofold direction-downward, yet forward. It brought man into the world and set his feet on progression's highway. - Orson F. Whitney


## Was the Fall a surprise?
- No
- It was positive.

## Was the Fall an accident?
- no
That this understood and agreed-upon fall of man would lead to the equally understood and agreed-upon atonement of Christ is one of the major contributions the Book of Mormon makes to our understanding of the plan of salvation.

# What shifts when we see the Fall as a blessing rather than a mistake?
The Garden of Eden was paradisical. Why, then, did Adam and Eve remain unperfected while there?
Why does it seem that Adam and Eve were given contradictory commandments?
How do the two commandments in Eden help us understand God's plan?

## The Two Commandments
- Moses 2:28: Procreate
- Moses 3:16-17: May eat any tree's fruit except the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, but you may choose for yourself. (the second "it" could refer to different things)

# Two truths can never be at variance
# Did Adam and Eve sin when they eat the fruit?
No

**transgressing**: traversing one state to another.


## The Realizations of Adam
Moses 5:10
## The Realizations of Eve

# Agency

The power to choose between good and evil
