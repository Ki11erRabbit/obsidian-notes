- What are the three pillars in the plan of salvation?
# Questions to Consider
- Why is the family God's laboratory?
- What do the Savior's teachings, titles, and gifts of repentance teach us about "happiness "

The home is to be God's laboratory of love and service.
Laboratory because we are testing things in a control environment with the expectation that things can go wrong or not go as planned.

# The Savior's Teaching

#### The Beatitudes
Matthew 5:1-12

# The Savior's Titles
Jesus Christ's titles teach us about happiness in family life

See God for who he is
