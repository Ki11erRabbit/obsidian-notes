# Questions to Consider
- What is a Chris-centered explanation of love?
- How is love an agentic verb, a process, and other centered?
- How can we make the decision to be married?


## Love
Is how Christ loves (charity)


## The Savior teaches that true love is an agentic verb

"True love is to be discovered as a decision." - Lynn G. Robbins, *Love is a Choice*

## True love is a Process and Other Centered
Marvin J. Ashton, "Love Takes Time"

"Because love is as much a verb as it is a noun, **the phrase "I love you" is as much as a promise of behavior and commitment** as it is an expression of feeling" - Lynn G Robbins, *Love is a Choice*

# The Marriage Decision

## As a general Rule, Heavenly Father will **NOT** Choose for you
