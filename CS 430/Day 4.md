A common way to define integers is through a pair of nats
(m, n) = m - n

5
- (10, 5) = 5
- (8, 3) = 5

(m', n') ~ (m, n)


a relation of a set is a subset of a cross product of that set (for a binary relation)

reflexivity: is every element related to itself
symmetry: if a is related to b and it b related to a
transitivity: if a is related to b and b related to c, is a related to c
