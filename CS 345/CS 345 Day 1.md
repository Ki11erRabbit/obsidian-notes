Operating System
* provides users with a simpler, cleaner model of the computer
* manages hardware
* allows programs to interact with each other and cooperate
* Often a suite of programs make up the 'operating system'
* we will focus on the kernel

## Challenges
* most contemporary os have millions of lines of code
* huge amounts of hardware
* tensions
  - efficiency vs generality
  - powerful interfaces vs simple interface
  - ease of use vs security
  - portability vs fully utilizing bespoke hardware features
* there isn't necessarily a "right way"

## What you will gain?
#### Understand
* how operating systems work
* design choices operating systems designers are faced with

#### Basis for further OS study and research

# Structure
Patterned after MIT 6.1810
* "learning by doing"
* course designed to teach you a lot
#### Focus on xv6
* A rewrite of Unix Version 6
* "Simple"
	* 6,000 lines
* You can understand all of the code!
	* Linux has > 40 million lines of code!
	* Nobody can understand it all! Not even Linus!

# Course Structure
#### Labs
* focus of course
#### Lecture/Lab Introduction Questions
#### Exams

# Lectures
* O/S general principles and concepts
* Discusso

#### Homework/Assigned Readings
* make a list of questions for each assigned reading

#### Lab Introduction Assignments
* read the lab instructions before the "Lab Introduction" assignment
* Turn in questions after doing the reading (can be comments as well)

# Labs
* "learning by doing" -> labs
* Three types
	* Systems
	* O/S Primitives
	* O/S Kernel extensions

* utilities 
* system calls
* pages tables/
* 

# Exams
* midterm
* final (comprehensive)
* Material from xv6 book, labs, lectures
* lectures not recorded
* slides will be provided
* p

# Reading materials
* xv6 book
* K&R, Risc-V (optional)
* Traditional OS texts (optional)
	* Tanenbaum, Bos
	* Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne
	* Arpaci-Dusseau

every lab will ask for an estimate for how long it takes you
# Lecture 1

* OS/360
	* Designed to run on the entire range of computers
	* multiprogramming
		* no longer batch
		* allow multiple programs to run simultaneously 

## History: MULTICS
* general electric, MIT, Bell Labs attempted to create a "computer utility"
* Limited success commercially
* Developed many seminal ideas in operating systems
	* privileged execution

## History: UNIX
* Bell labs dropped out of Multics
* Ken Thompson took several ideas from MULTICS and created a simplied version

## History: Personal Computers
* Eventually supplanted workstations
	* Pattern: inexpensive supplants more expensive

## Contemporary Operating Systems
* Linux/Android
	* Clone of Unix
* macOS/iOS
	* Mach -> NeXT -> macOS
	* Hybrid Kernel
* Windows
	* Inspired by Mach
	* Hybrid Kernel
* We will focus on UNIX


# TODO
* review ex1-8
* xv6 book chapter 1
* get development environment set up
